        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Hey there, I'm Bejoseholo, and I'm passionate about turning data into actionable insights. When I'm not diving into spreadsheets or coding away, you'll often find me lacing up my running shoes for a jog in the great outdoors or volunteering at local community organizations.</p>

        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>My journey into the world of data analysis began with a solid foundation in mechanical engineering. During my final year, I delved into the intricacies of software development, focusing on creating tools to calculate mechanical elements. This hands-on experience not only sharpened my problem-solving skills but also sparked my curiosity about the power of data.</p>
        <p>After graduation, I explored various career paths, including roles as a Workshop Facilitator at TERN and as the Chief Executive Officer of Instant Pickup. In these positions, I honed my communication skills and gained valuable insights into business strategy and development.</p>
        <p>It wasn't until later that I discovered my true passion for data analysis and decided to take the plunge into formal education with General Assembly's Data Analyst Boot Camp. Over the course of several months, I immersed myself in the world of data analysis, learning everything from SQL and Python programming to machine learning and statistical analysis. It was a challenging yet incredibly rewarding experience that equipped me with the skills I needed to thrive in the field of data analytics.</p>
